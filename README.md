# Disaster Image Based Relief Planning

Image visualization for Optimal resource deployment is one of the essential parts of various methods to analyze and interpret the post disaster images. The primary challenge in this work is to analyze complex images involving extreme destruction and fatality. The Dataset used in this work is the CDD (Comprehensive Disaster Dataset) which provides us the accuracy of 87% post involvement of various Machine learning and Optimization Techniques.
